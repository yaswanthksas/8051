Great question! Let's compare both instructions in terms of **size**, **structure**, and **reason behind their byte usage in the 8051 microcontroller**.

### âœ… 1. Instruction: `MOV R0, #0x30`

* **Size**: **2 bytes**
* **Type**: **Register with immediate**
* **Breakdown**:

  * **1 byte**: Opcode for `MOV R0, #data`
  * **1 byte**: Immediate data (`0x30`)

#### âœ” Why only 2 bytes?

* `R0` is one of the 8 general-purpose registers (`R0â€“R7`) in the **register bank**.
* The CPU knows from the **opcode** which register is targeted (`R0` here).
* Hence, there's no need to mention the register address explicitly.

### âœ… 2. Instruction: `MOV addr, #0x45`

* **Size**: **3 bytes**
* **Type**: **Direct addressing with immediate**
* **Breakdown**:

  * **1 byte**: Opcode for `MOV direct, #data`
  * **1 byte**: Direct address (`addr`) of internal RAM or SFR
  * **1 byte**: Immediate data (`0x45`)

#### âœ” Why 3 bytes?

* `addr` can refer to any of:

  * Lower 128 bytes of internal RAM (0x00â€“0x7F), or
  * Special Function Registers (SFRs) at 0x80â€“0xFF
* The **direct address must be explicitly specified** in the instruction, since it's not encoded into the opcode.
* So, the assembler needs 1 byte for the opcode, 1 for the address, and 1 for the data.

### ðŸ“Š Summary Table

| Instruction       | Size | Why?                             |
| ----------------- | ---- | -------------------------------- |
| `MOV R0, #0x30`   | 2 B  | Register ID is encoded in opcode |
| `MOV addr, #0x45` | 3 B  | Direct address must be included  |

---

### ðŸ“˜ Conclusion: Why the difference?

* **Register instructions (R0â€“R7)** use **compact opcodes** because the register name is encoded into the 3 least significant bits of the opcode.
* **Direct memory/SFR access** needs a full **8-bit address field**, increasing instruction size to 3 bytes.

Let me know if you want the **hex encoding** of these instructions or how they look in **machine code**!
